Design and architecture are related concepts, but they refer to different aspects of software development.

Design refers to the process of creating a plan or blueprint for how a software system will be built. 
This includes defining the functionality of the system, the user interface, and the algorithms and data 
structures that will be used to implement it. Design decisions are typically made early in the development 
process and may be revisited as the system evolves.

Architecture, on the other hand, refers to the high-level structure of a software system. This includes 
how the system is organized into components, how those components interact with each other, and how data 
flows between them. Architecture decisions are typically made early in the development process and have a 
significant impact on the overall structure and maintainability of the system.

Clean architecture, Onion architecture, and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) are all approaches to software architecture 
that aim to create flexible, maintainable, and scalable software systems.

Clean architecture is an architecture pattern that emphasizes the separation of concerns and the 
independence of components. 
    It is based on the principles of dependency inversion and single responsibility, 
    It emphasizes the use of interfaces to decouple components.

Onion architecture is a similar architecture pattern that also emphasizes separation of concerns and 
the independence of components. 
    It is based on the principle of inversion of control
    It organizes components into layers, with each layer having a specific responsibility.

DDD, on the other hand, is a broader design approach that emphasizes the importance of the domain model 
in software development. DDD provides a set of concepts and patterns, such as aggregates, entities, 
value objects, and repositories, to help developers create a flexible and maintainable domain model. 
DDD is not tied to any specific architecture pattern, although it can be implemented using a variety 
of architecture patterns, including Clean Architecture and Onion Architecture.

In summary, design and architecture are both important aspects of software development, and approaches like Clean 
architecture, Onion architecture, and Domain-Driven Design can help create flexible, maintainable, and scalable 
software systems.


    Architectures:

    Monolithic architecture
    Microservices architecture
    Service-oriented architecture (SOA)
    Event-driven architecture (EDA)
    Serverless architecture
    Clean Architecture
    Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters Architecture)
    Onion Architecture
    Designs:

    Model-View-Controller (MVC)
    Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)
    Model-View-Presenter (MVP)
    Component-based design
    Domain-driven design (DDD)
    Test-driven development (TDD)
    Behavior-driven development (BDD)
    Agile design

Note that this is not an exhaustive list, and there may be other architectures and designs that 
are not included here. Additionally, some of these architectures and designs may overlap or be used 
in conjunction with each other, depending on the specific requirements of a given project.
