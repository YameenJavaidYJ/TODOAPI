/*
The Command Bus Pattern is a design pattern that is commonly used in software applications to provide 
a separation of concerns between the application's infrastructure and the application's business logic. 
The Command Bus Pattern is typically used in conjunction with the Command Design Pattern to provide a clean separation between the execution of a command and the business logic associated with that command.

Some of the advantages of using the Command Bus Pattern in a software application include:

Better Separation of Concerns: By separating the execution of a command from the business logic associated 
with that command, the Command Bus Pattern provides a cleaner separation of concerns in the application's 
codebase.

Simplified Error Handling: By handling errors in a consistent manner across all commands, the Command Bus 
Pattern makes it easier to identify and fix errors in the application's codebase.

Easier Testing: The Command Bus Pattern makes it easier to test individual commands in isolation, which 
can improve the quality of the application's test suite.

Improved Flexibility: The Command Bus Pattern makes it easier to add new commands to the application without having to modify the existing codebase.

Improved Reusability: The Command Bus Pattern makes it easier to reuse existing commands in new contexts, which can help reduce development time and cost.

In summary, the Command Bus Pattern provides a number of benefits that can help improve the quality, maintainability, and flexibility of a software application. By separating the execution of commands from the business logic associated with those commands, the Command Bus Pattern can help create a cleaner, more modular codebase that is easier to test, maintain, and extend over time.
