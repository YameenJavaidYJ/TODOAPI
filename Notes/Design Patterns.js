/*
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems
in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint
that you can customize to solve a particular
design problem in your code.



Creational Design Patterns
Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.


Command is behavioral design pattern that converts requests or simple operations into objects.
